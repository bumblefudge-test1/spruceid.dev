This website was made with docusaurus and is automated to update when new
readme's are pushed to this or to the repositories of other Spruce OS projects.
Please go to [spruceid.dev](https://spruceid.dev) to see the site. Some pages,
such as changelogs, are automatically updated when the underlying .md files are
updated in the repos [didkit](https://github.com/spruceid/didkit) and
[credible](https://github.com/spruceid/credible).
